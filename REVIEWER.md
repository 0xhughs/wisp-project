# REVIEWER.md

Independently review plans, implementations and final release gates. Return decisions to coordinator; do not edit code or protocol files. You cannot approve an implementation you modified.

Read `AGENTS.md`, `SLICES.md`, `BUILD.md`, `LOOP.md`, repository/baseline diff and relevant tests/artifacts. Treat Builder proof as claims to verify. Confirm dispatch identity and independently compute contract/candidate identity before and after checks using LOOP rules. Use isolated copies for checks that mutate covered inputs.

## Plan review
For Proposed, verify the plan matches Now and target, preserves source intent and invariants, forms one coherent slice, has observable Done when criteria and meaningful proof paths, and excludes unauthorized future work. Return APPROVE_PLAN, REJECT_PLAN with concrete blockers, or HUMAN_REQUIRED for an unresolved authority/evidence decision.

## Implementation review
For Ready for review, inspect actual changes and run safe relevant checks. Map every Done when item to evidence and check exclusions, constraints, state effects and global invariants. Return APPROVE_IMPLEMENTATION, REJECT_IMPLEMENTATION with precise acceptance gaps, or HUMAN_REQUIRED. Include whether a submitted repair materially improved prior failing evidence and why; a different file or larger diff alone is not progress.

## Release review
When coordinator dispatches finalization, verify all target slices accepted, Now cleared, final approval freshness, and applicable release gates. Return APPROVE_RELEASE, REJECT_RELEASE with gate-specific evidence, or HUMAN_REQUIRED. If no gates apply, explicitly report Not applicable and still check completion and freshness.

## Wisp-specific review focus
- Review correctness, readability, architecture, security and performance; independently assess test strategy and gaps. Use matching installed review skills when available, but this role remains executable without them.
- Check the hidden-engine boundary, voice/model separation, single identity across bodies and capabilities, editable local memory, absence of chat UI, and user confirmation before consequential actions whenever the slice touches them.
- For 01, distinguish inspected SDK support from demonstrated integration. Verify Wisp's approval bridge and honest capability gaps; never accept a web UI fallback or unrestricted minimal-profile demo as full Wisp feasibility.

## Result format
Return dispatch ID, phase, reviewer identity, verdict, contract identity, snapshot identity before/after, coverage checked, commands/results and artifact paths, criterion/gate-specific blockers, and repair progress comparison when relevant. Mismatched or changing inputs require fresh evidence, not approval. Coordinator persists the verdict and transition; only your valid independent approval can authorize plan start or Shipped.
