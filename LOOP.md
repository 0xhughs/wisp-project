# LOOP.md

## Authority and roles
- Work only through the Loop target in `SLICES.md`, preserving `AGENTS.md` and user authorization. `Shipped` means independently accepted, not deployed.
- Coordinator is the sole writer of protocol files and archives. Builder writes application code/tests and returns proposed contract edits and proof. Reviewer reads and verifies; it returns verdicts and never implements fixes.
- Coordinator records Reviewer decisions verbatim. Only a valid independent Reviewer verdict authorizes `Not started` or `Shipped`. Any participant may report a blocker or escalation; coordinator persists it.
- Use one active worker per checkout. A second coordinator must not start while ownership is unresolved. Record coordinator and worker identities in `BUILD.md`; stop/confirm the former owner before takeover.

## Execution setup
- Prepared is an unstarted pack, not a runtime blocker. Confirm the selected target and actual build authorization before the first worker dispatch; never interpret a repository URL or pack-authoring request as permission to execute the roadmap.
- Use distinct independent Builder and Reviewer agents. Initialize the Reviewer with project files and repository evidence, not Builder reasoning or a persona switch in the coordinator's context. Do not use the Builder as its own Reviewer.
- Before dispatch, persist the actual tool adapter, how it launches/checks/waits/stops workers, coordinator identity, and the worker role. Tool availability is not evidence that a worker was launched.
- If independent execution or verification is unavailable, preserve evidence and use Human required with the exact limitation. Do not self-approve. No background scheduler is authorized by this pack.
- Source investigation may inform the initial contract; application implementation still requires an applicable independent plan approval. Subsequent proposal drafting is a no-code Builder phase.

## Dispatch and recovery
On the first authorized dispatch set SLICES Run status to `Running`. When blocked or escalated, mirror `Blocked` or `Human required` there; after resolution restore `Running` or `Finalizing` as appropriate.

1. On resume, read live files and check recorded worker status, pending result, counters, snapshot identities, blocker and advance phase. Reconcile runtime activity before editing or dispatching.
2. Persist unique dispatch ID, role, phase, input identity and pending launch before starting the worker. Record returned agent ID. If launch was interrupted, discover or stop the old worker; never assume it did not start.
3. Builder receives the current contract and blockers. Reviewer receives current project files, candidate, baseline/diff and dispatch ID; its context is independent of Builder reasoning.
4. Wait for confirmed completion before changing ownership. Capture the result durably in BUILD `Pending result` (SLICES `Pending release result` for release reviews), then validate the dispatch, phase, input identity, and worker identity. Reject stale or duplicate messages as control events, without incrementing review-rejection counters.
5. Coordinator applies verdict, counters, event and `last consumed dispatch` together in one atomic `BUILD.md` replacement, then clears pending result. For release results, use the same atomic event/counter/consumed-ID transaction in SLICES Release evidence (including a pending-result field); reconcile BUILD advance phase afterward. Do not use a BUILD consumed marker alone to decide whether a release failure was counted. A crash before replacement leaves a replayable pending result; a crash after it cannot apply the verdict twice.
6. Workers never edit protocol files. Reviewer checks must not mutate candidate inputs; run mutating checks in an exact isolated copy. Unexpected external edits invalidate affected approvals. Do not overwrite unrelated user edits when persisting state.

## Snapshot and contract identity
Before first dispatch, record reproducible capture/recheck commands, coverage, exclusions and baseline in `BUILD.md`. Coverage includes source, tests, configuration, lockfiles, relevant assets and required untracked files. Exclude only named irrelevant/generated/dependency paths; Reviewer verifies coverage. Do not include secret values in proof.

A clean Git commit ID is sufficient only after confirming no relevant staged, unstaged or untracked content differs. Otherwise use a SHA-256 content manifest with sorted relative paths, file bytes, types, executable modes, and symlink targets. Detect additions and deletions by regenerating the covered file list. Record the manifest location and digest; without Git use this same manifest approach. The baseline must be available for comparison. Do not create commits merely to manufacture identity.

Contract identity covers the substantive `AGENTS.md`, product/target/criteria in `SLICES.md`, `BUILD.md` slice ID and Goal through Tests, and operational rules in `LOOP.md` and both role files. Include snapshot capture/recheck commands, coverage and exclusions in contract identity even though their values live in Loop state. Define exact extraction/hash commands; exclude only mutable bookkeeping (Proof, Review, Loop state, Status, Next, run status, release evidence and Shipped/Now placement). Preserve mapped slice content and target membership in the contract even if placement changes. Store manifests outside their own coverage. State-only writes must not invalidate approvals.

Reviewer independently computes identities before and after its checks and records both plus commands, results and artifact paths. Accept approval only if they match dispatch inputs and coordinator recomputation. Before Builder starts, validate plan approval against its baseline and contract. Before archiving or releasing, validate implementation approval against current candidate and contract. Changed contract -> `Proposed`; changed code after approval -> fresh plan review before implementation if baseline changed, or `Ready for review` for an otherwise unchanged completed contract. Never reuse stale proof. Intended Builder edits after valid plan approval produce the implementation candidate; they do not themselves require another plan review. For example, an external edit to an already-completed candidate with the accepted baseline and contract unchanged requires fresh implementation review, not another plan review.

## State transitions
| From | Required event | To / next action |
|---|---|---|
| Proposed | Reviewer APPROVE_PLAN with matching inputs | Not started; Builder may start |
| Proposed | Reviewer REJECT_PLAN | Proposed; Builder revises proposal, then fresh plan review |
| Not started | Valid plan approval, Builder dispatch | Building |
| Building | Builder completes proof and stops | Ready for review; independent review |
| Ready for review | Reviewer REJECT_IMPLEMENTATION | Building; Builder repairs, then review |
| Ready for review | Reviewer APPROVE_IMPLEMENTATION with matching inputs | Shipped; coordinator advances |
| Any unfinished state | Temporary recoverable blocker | Blocked; persist recovery fields |
| Any state | Authority, evidence, retry or budget escalation | Human required; stop |

A revised proposal always returns to plan review. Builder may never alter accepted criteria to make a failure pass. If a necessary contract change is within existing authority, persist it and return to `Proposed`; otherwise escalate. Re-reviewing changed accepted code invalidates the old implementation approval and follows the same gates.

## Durable retry and budget policy
Default limits: 3 Reviewer rejections per slice; 2 consecutive repair attempts with no material improvement to failing evidence. Record user overrides here. Count both plan and implementation rejections, even when the reported gap changes. Plan approval, restart, worker replacement and phase change do not reset rejection count.

For each unique accepted review result, append event ID/dispatch, phase, verdict, input identities, acceptance gaps, evidence comparison and updated counters to `Review events`. Increment rejection count once for each REJECT verdict. After a repair, Reviewer compares evidence against prior open gaps: no material improvement increments no-progress; material improvement resets only no-progress. Initial rejection is not itself a repair. Missing comparison evidence must be resolved before another repair dispatch.

Check limits after recording the event and before another attempt. At either limit set `Human required`, including reason and last evidence. Freeze final counter totals on implementation approval for the archive. Reset counters only for a new slice or explicit human authorization with a recorded reason. An unknown legacy count requires reconciliation, not an assumed zero.

Record an execution budget only if configured. Persist consumption using the available measurement source across resumes; inability to measure a required budget is a blocker. Check budget before dispatch and after result; when exhausted, preserve work and set `Human required` before more work.

## Block and resume
Use `Blocked` only for a temporary dependency with a concrete safe recheck and bounded retry time/attempt limit. Save prior status, exact next action, blocker, evidence, recheck condition and deadline in `Loop state`. Keep counters, pending review result, approvals and dispatch records. Confirm any worker is stopped before resuming another.

On re-entry, perform only the allowed recheck. If unchanged, remain blocked without dispatching work or claiming background activity. If the limit expires or required permission/resource cannot be obtained, set `Human required`. If resolved, validate identities and restore prior status/action, routing changed contracts/candidates back through the appropriate review gate. Clear blocker fields only after recording resolution. Unknown ownership cannot resume on timeout alone.

`Human required` resumes only after the specific missing decision/resource/authorization is supplied and evidenced. Record the resolution and restore the earliest unmet gate; retain counters unless explicitly reset. Do not escalate routine reversible implementation decisions.

## Archive, advance and completion
1. After valid implementation approval, persist `Shipped` and advance phase `archive pending`. Keep the approved identity and final counters. No worker may write code during advance.
2. Copy the accepted BUILD page to its stable archive path; never overwrite differing history. If the path already contains the same slice, verdict and approved identities, verify its substantive record and reuse it. A disagreement requires reconciliation. Persist `archive written` after verification; bookkeeping differences alone do not require a second archive.
3. Add the slice once to Shipped in `SLICES.md`. If authorized target work remains, select exactly one next Now slice, record advance phase `next selected` plus `Next slice ID / draft` separately from the retained BUILD receipt ID, and dispatch a Builder draft-proposal phase for that next ID (no code edits). Only after archive verification replace BUILD with the next slice's Proposed page and zeroed counters. Plan review is required before code changes.
4. After the last target slice, set Now to `None — target complete`, preserve future Later slices, retain the last Shipped BUILD as a receipt, set advance phase `release pending`, and set run status to `Finalizing`. No new Builder dispatch is allowed solely because BUILD remains Shipped.
5. Independent Reviewer checks applicable release gates against the final candidate and contract. Store verdict, identity and actual evidence in SLICES. With no gates, record `Not applicable` and verify target completion and approval freshness. Before success, coordinator rechecks those identities. Set run status `Complete`, advance phase `complete`, Next `None — target complete`, and stop.
6. A gate failure cannot produce Complete: preserve its evidence, set run status `Needs repair`, and draft one Proposed repair slice only if it fits existing target/authority. Otherwise set Human required. Give repair slices the normal review and retry gates; preserve previous archives. Bound repeated release repairs to 3 failed release reviews per target by default, recorded in SLICES; at the limit set Human required. Do not reset that count by creating another repair slice.

On interruption during advance, reconcile archive, Shipped entry, next selection and BUILD by slice ID and approved identities; continue the first unfinished step. Never rebuild accepted work merely because archiving was interrupted. If a draft was not persisted, regenerate only the next proposal. If completed-run inputs later change, invalidate Complete and re-review or propose authorized repair; do not overwrite the accepted archive.

Success requires: all target slices accepted, Now empty, matching final evidence, applicable gates passed or explicitly not applicable, no unresolved blocker/escalation, and run status Complete. It does not authorize publishing, deployment, future scope, or continued background execution.
